hncli: Hacker News Command Line Interface.

Clever name, huh?

The HN API is a bit unusual. There are only GET requests and there is no way to retrieve many items are once.
So, there will be as many requests sent up to the fetch-limit variable.

$ xcrun swift run hncli

will run with the default values. Five new items will be retrieved.

$ xcrun swift run hncli --top

Specifies that you want the top items and not the new items.

$ xcrun swift run hncli --top --fetch-limit 10

Specifies that you want 10 top items.
